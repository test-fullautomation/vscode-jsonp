## Getting Started

This is a vscode extension supports enhanced JSON syntax (is called as `jsonp`)
which is used by [python-jsonpreprocessor](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-jsonpreprocessor) package.

### How to install
This extension is currently not available on 
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) or
[Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/), so you can install it manually as 
following steps:
- Get the latest extension `jsonp-x.x.x.vsix` file from this repo.
- Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or 
[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), select **Extensions** Tab then cho 
**Install from VSIX**
- Browse to the downloaded `jsonp-x.x.x.vsix` file then install.

As soon as the installtion is completed, the files with `.jsonp` will be 
recognized properly.

## Features

Besides the [basic JSON syntax](https://www.json.org/), this extension helps
to recognize and highlight the `jsonp` which includes:

- `"[import]"` syntax:

   ![jsonp-import](./images/jsonp-import.png)

- `param-assignment` syntax:

   ![jsonp-param-assignment](./images/jsonp-param-assignment.png)

With new supported `jsonp` syntax, the JSON value and object syntax are
updated as below:

- `value`:

   ![jsonp-value](./images/jsonp-value.png)

- `object`:

   ![jsonp-object](./images/jsonp-object.png)

## Extension Settings

When installing this vscode extension successfully, all files with `.jsonp` 
extension will be automatically highlighted as `jsonp` systax.

In case you want files with `.json` are also recognized as `jsonp` syntax, the
below setting is required in vscode `settings.json` files:
```
"files.associations": {
   "*.json": "jsonp"
},
```
